I am a Research Assistant at the Databases and Information Systems group at Freie Universitaet Berlin. My research focuses on data management and analysis of mobility data and social media posts. I am interested in analysis of mobility and social network data, large-scale data processing on MapReduce-based frameworks and applications of machine learning, e.g., in the fields of computational social science, recommender systems and predictive analytics.

Besides work, I enjoy traveling, learning foreign languages, cooking and running. Having lived and worked in 5 countries, I feel at home in multicultural environments.
